### Subcategory   ➡️   Computer Vision

### Difficulty   ➡️   (Basic)

## 🌲 Context

In the heart of a lush forest, biologists are on a mission to unravel the mysteries of butterfly species. Cameras set up throughout the forest capture thousands of images, creating a need for a technological solution to identify butterflies within these photos efficiently.

As a data scientist, your expertise is crucial for developing a solution that automates the process of detecting and identifying butterflies, aiding the biologists in their study.

## 🎯 Objectives

Your task is to create a neural network model that can process images from forest cameras and accurately detect the presence of butterflies. This model must differentiate butterflies from other insects, adapting to various lighting conditions and angles.

## 📁 Dataset

You will be provided with a dataset comprising images taken from the forest, with various scenes including different animals, plants, and insects. Some images will contain butterflies, while others will not.

### Download Links:

- For the testing dataset: [Download test.zip](https://cdn.nuwe.io/joboffers-data/dl2/test.zip)

## 🗄️ Repo Structure:

The repository structure is provided and must be adhered to strictly:

```
nuwe-data-dl2/
├── data
│   └── labels_path.csv
├── model.py
├── predictions
│   ├── example_predictions.json
│   └── predictions.json
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt

```

The `predictions` folder will contain the `predictions.json` file with your model's predictions on whether an image contains a butterfly or not.

## 🎯 Tasks:

Develop a neural network to process and detect butterflies in images from forest cameras, contributing to the biologists' research efforts.

## 📊 Data Processing:

Data preprocessing should be applied to normalize and prepare the images for the model, considering the various lighting conditions and angles present in the dataset.

## 🤖 Model:

Select and train a neural network capable of distinguishing butterflies from other elements in the images. You may experiment with different architectures, like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to find the most effective solution.

## 📤 Submission

Submit a `predictions.json` file containing the model's predictions for each image. The file should be correctly formatted, with the image file identifier as the key and the predicted presence of a butterfly as the value.
`predictions.json`:
```json
{
    "target": {
        "image1.jpg": 0,
        "image2.jpg": 1,
        "image3.jpg": 1,
        ...
    }
}
```
## 📊 Evaluation

Performance will be measured using accuracy and F1 Score to ensure precision and recall, offering a balanced view of the model's ability to detect butterflies.

**⚠️ Please note:**  
All submissions will undergo a manual code review process to ensure that the work has been conducted honestly and adheres to the highest standards of academic integrity. Any form of dishonesty or misconduct will be addressed seriously, and may lead to disqualification from the challenge.
The file to be evaluated will be **predictions.json**. This file must be inside **/predictions**.
